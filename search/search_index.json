Overview (INTERACTIVE!) \u00b6 Copy this example and paste it in the terminal below to get an idea of what this package does: from ioc_finder import find_iocs text = \"This is just an foobar.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php\" iocs = find_iocs ( text ) iocs [ 'domains' ] iocs [ 'urls' ] This terminal uses Pyodide to provide a Python3.9 runtime in the browser using WebAssembly . Enjoy! Capabilities \u00b6 Data types found by ioc-finder Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) (in multiple formats such as asn1234 and as 1234 ) Bitcoin addresses (P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32) CIDR ranges (currently ipv4 ranges; ipv6 ranges coming soon) CVEs (e.g. CVE-2014-1234 ) Domain names (support for Unicode domain names (e.g. \u0229xample.com ) is coming soon) Email addresses (both standard format (e.g. test@example.com ) and an email with an IP address as the domain (e.g. test@[192.168.0.1] )) File hashes (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, and import hashes , and authentihashes ) File paths ( beta ) Google Adsense Publisher IDs Google Analytics Tracker IDs IP address (IPv4 and IPv6) MAC addresses ( beta ) Monero (crypto-currency) addresses Registry key paths (e.g. \"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows ) SSDeep hashes ( beta ) URLs (URLs with and without schemes) User agents ( beta ) XMPP addresses (basically, this captures email addresses whose domain names contain \"jabber\" or \"xmpp\") MITRE ATT&CK data (see more info ): Pre-attack tactics and techniques (and sub-techniques ) Enterprise mitigations, tactics, and techniques (and sub-techniques ) Mobile mitigations, tactics, and techniques (and sub-techniques ) TLP labels Have another data-type you would like ioc-finder to parse? Raise an issue and we'll see what we can do! Configuration Options This library also provides options to: Parse domain name from a URL Parse domain name from an email address Parse IP address from a CIDR range Parse URLs without a scheme (e.g. without https:// ) Parse import hashes and authentihashes Known Limitations When parsing registry key paths , this library will NOT properly parse a registry key path where the last section contains a space. For example, <HKCU>\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\explorer\\advanced on will be parsed as <HKCU>\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\explorer\\advanced (the space in the final section is removed). The items listed above (in the \"Capabilities\" section) that are postceded by \"( beta )\" are not very robust and may still have major issues. Any feedback or issues related to these items are much appreciated. When parsing markdown , if there is a domain name that is surrounded by underscores (which would make the domain name italic in some flavours of markdown - e.g. _google.com_ ), the domain will be parsed including the leading underscore (e.g. _google.com_ would be parsed as _google.com ). Feedback \u00b6 If you have any ideas to improve this package, please raise an issue ! Other Helpful Projects \u00b6 You may also be interested in https://github.com/ioc-fang/ioc_fanger , a project to fang and defang indicators of compromise. For example, defanging: example.com => example[.]com https://example.com => hXXps://example[.]com and fanging: example[.]com => example.com example(.)com => example.com me AT example(.)com => me@example.com Similar Projects \u00b6 There are a number of projects available to find Indicators of Compromise. Your mileage may vary with them. If there are things that another package can do that you would like to see in this package, let me know ). Here are a few other ones: https://github.com/InQuest/python-iocextract https://github.com/sroberts/cacador https://github.com/armbues/ioc_parser Credits \u00b6 This project uses the ioc_fanger package to make sure that all indicators in the text are properly fanged .

Python \u00b6 The primary function in this package is the ioc_finder.find_iocs() function. A simple usage looks like: from ioc_finder import find_iocs text = \"This is just an example.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php\" iocs = find_iocs ( text ) print ( 'Domains: {} ' . format ( iocs [ 'domains' ])) print ( 'URLs: {} ' . format ( iocs [ 'urls' ])) Inputs \u00b6 You must pass some text into the find_iocs() function as string (the iocs will be parsed from this text). You can also provide the options detailed below. Options \u00b6 The find_iocs takes the following keywords (all of them default to True ): parse_domain_from_url (default=True): Whether or not to parse domain names from URLs (e.g. example.com from https://example.com/test ) parse_from_url_path (default=True): Whether or not to parse observables from URL paths (e.g. 2f3ec0e4998909bb0efab13c82d30708ca9f88679e42b75ef13ea0466951d862 from https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2f3ec0e4998909bb0efab13c82d30708ca9f88679e42b75ef13ea0466951d862/detection ) parse_domain_from_email_address (default=True): Whether or not to parse domain names from email addresses (e.g. example.com from foo@example.com ) parse_address_from_cidr (default=True): Whether or not to parse IP addresses from CIDR ranges (e.g. 0.0.0.1 from 0.0.0.1/24 ) parse_urls_without_scheme (default=True): Whether or not to parse URLs without a scheme (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Generic_syntax ) (e.g. hightower.space/projects ) parse_imphashes (default=True): Parse import hashes (which look like md5s, but are preceded by 'imphash' or 'import hash') parse_authentihashes (default=True): Parse authentihashes (which look like sha256s, but are preceded with 'authentihash') See test_ioc_finder.py for more examples. Output \u00b6 The find_iocs() returns a dictionary in the following structure: { \"asns\" : [], \"attack_mitigations\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [] }, \"attack_tactics\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"attack_techniques\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"authentihashes\" : [], \"bitcoin_addresses\" : [], \"cves\" : [], \"domains\" : [], \"email_addresses\" : [], \"email_addresses_complete\" : [], \"file_paths\" : [], \"google_adsense_publisher_ids\" : [], \"google_analytics_tracker_ids\" : [], \"imphashes\" : [], \"ipv4_cidrs\" : [], \"ipv4s\" : [], \"ipv6s\" : [], \"mac_addresses\" : [], \"md5s\" : [], \"monero_addresses\" : [], \"registry_key_paths\" : [], \"sha1s\" : [], \"sha256s\" : [], \"sha512s\" : [], \"ssdeeps\" : [], \"tlp_labels\" : [], \"urls\" : [], \"user_agents\" : [], \"xmpp_addresses\" : [] } For example, running the example code shown at the start of the usage section above produces the following output: { \"asns\" : [], \"attack_mitigations\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [] }, \"attack_tactics\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"attack_techniques\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"authentihashes\" : [], \"bitcoin_addresses\" : [], \"cves\" : [], \"domains\" : [ \"example.org\" , \"example.com\" ], \"email_addresses\" : [], \"email_addresses_complete\" : [], \"file_paths\" : [], \"google_adsense_publisher_ids\" : [], \"google_analytics_tracker_ids\" : [], \"imphashes\" : [], \"ipv4_cidrs\" : [], \"ipv4s\" : [], \"ipv6s\" : [], \"mac_addresses\" : [], \"md5s\" : [], \"monero_addresses\" : [], \"registry_key_paths\" : [], \"sha1s\" : [], \"sha256s\" : [], \"sha512s\" : [], \"ssdeeps\" : [], \"tlp_labels\" : [], \"urls\" : [ \"https://example.org/test/bingo.php\" ], \"user_agents\" : [], \"xmpp_addresses\" : [] } Output Details \u00b6 There are two grammars for email addresses. There is a fairly complete grammar to find email addresses matching the spec (which is very broad). Any of these complete email addresses (e.g. foo\"bar@gmail.com ) will be sent as output to in email_addresses_complete key. Email addresses in the simple form we are familiar with (e.g. bar@gmail.com ) will be sent as output in the email_addresses key. Parsing Specific Indicator Types \u00b6 If you need to parse a specific indicator type, you can do this using one of the parse functions that start with parse_ . For example, the code below will parse URLs: from ioc_finder import parse_urls text = 'https://google.com' results = parse_urls ( prepare_text ( text )) print ( results ) If you use a parse function for a specific indicator type, we recommend that you first call the prepare_text function which fangs (e.g. hXXps://example[.]com => https://example.com ) the text before parsing indicators from it. In the future, more functionality will be added to the prepare_text function making it advantageous to call this function before parsing indicators. Command-Line Interface \u00b6 The ioc-finder package can be used from a command line like: ioc-finder \"This is just an example.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php\" This will return: { \"asns\" : [], \"attack_mitigations\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [] }, \"attack_tactics\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"attack_techniques\" : { \"enterprise\" : [], \"mobile\" : [], \"pre_attack\" : [] }, \"authentihashes\" : [], \"bitcoin_addresses\" : [], \"cves\" : [], \"domains\" : [ \"example.com\" , \"example.org\" ], \"email_addresses\" : [], \"email_addresses_complete\" : [], \"file_paths\" : [], \"google_adsense_publisher_ids\" : [], \"google_analytics_tracker_ids\" : [], \"imphashes\" : [], \"ipv4_cidrs\" : [], \"ipv4s\" : [], \"ipv6s\" : [], \"mac_addresses\" : [], \"md5s\" : [], \"monero_addresses\" : [], \"registry_key_paths\" : [], \"sha1s\" : [], \"sha256s\" : [], \"sha512s\" : [], \"ssdeeps\" : [], \"tlp_labels\" : [], \"urls\" : [ \"https://example.org/test/bingo.php\" ], \"user_agents\" : [], \"xmpp_addresses\" : [] } Here are the usage instructions for the CLI: Usage: ioc-finder [OPTIONS] TEXT CLI interface for parsing indicators of compromise.
